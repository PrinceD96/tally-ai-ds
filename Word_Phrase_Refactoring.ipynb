My father's a picky eater but loved the lamb chops with zucchini. I ordered a salad with salmon and it was superb. I look forward to trying other items on the menu   \n",

I had the halibut which was paired perfectly with a side a veggies. Great cocktails as well. I had a high top by the bar which worked well for not having a reservation. The food menu looks great. It was a nice switch up from a lot of the bar type menus in the area.   \n",

The place has a classic look with red chairs. It's spacious and intimate with dimly lit light areas. There's also an outside area that is heated so you can do that even in the colder months confortab. Staff was warm and welcoming. Loved the food as well. Had the Shepard's pie and a ceviche dish, both awesome.   \n",

Highly reccomend Maracuya Mamá (passionfruit) and Incas Trail (chicha morada) wow as a latina these made me extremely happy to see the thought placed into these cocktails. The ambiance is intimate and cozy I love the projectors and old film vibes really created a great all around experience for my date. Must try the cocktails!!!!   \n",

              "4   So they don't really have any vegan options not sure why it says that. The only thing they have in the menu is a pear salad which was actually very good. However, once I told the waitress I was vegan she checked with the kitchen to see if they could make me a pasta dish. Their green pasta is vegan friendly so they made me a very delish dish with veggies and red sauce. She made sure it fit my dietary need and on the plus side didn't make a big deal like other places. She was more than happy to make sure I would get a good meal. While I'm disappointed that they didn't have anything in the menu. The fact that she went above and beyond to make sure they could make me something was very much appreciated. Overall prices is what I would expect from a good restaurant. My husband enjoyed the herbed roasted chicken dish. He said the sauce was so good he wish he could just take some to go.   \n",

So since I had been waiting for about 20-30 minutes, I suddenly saw that my waiter, Michael, had put some bread on the table without me asking. I thought that was sweet and I appreciated that he noticed that I had been waiting a while. Thanks!   \n",

              "9   Booked this restaurant as it seemed off the beaten path of the typical tourist Times Square restaurant, but close enough to have dinner before a show. The outdoor/indoor courtyard was the best part of the dining experience. The food was very average and the quest for a Times Square-adjacent, GOOD restaurant continues. For entrees, we had the green pasta with shrimp (tasted like mediocre Alfredo you would get at an Olive Garden), lamb chops (NOT good), and the scallops, which tasted okay but were mini scallops, which none of us had seen before. All in all, it was a mediocre meal. It suited our needs but I would not go back and would definitely not recommend it to someone looking for a good pre-theater meal.   \n",
